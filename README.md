# 3DGraphicsEngine
This is a educational hobby project aminig to implement a simple 3D Graphics Engine from scratch.

It is a software based rasterization pipeline implementation. After implementing
3D Graphics Engines using well-known APIs like Direct3D and OpenGL, it can be also
good to get ones' hands dirty by implementing a software based rasterization pipeline
to comprehend hardware controlled pipeline stages of rasterization.

Model View Projection transformations, FPS camera, clipping, depth buffer, and texturing are implemented
and final image rendered on the command prompt. It is possible to render an image 30+ fps using models
with less than 1k polygons.  

The whole project is created and tested using VS 2017.
